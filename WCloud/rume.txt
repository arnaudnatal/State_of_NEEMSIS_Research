Anthropology has long shown that kinship, marriage, and systems of production and accumulation are deeply intertwined. In rural Tamil Nadu’s increasingly financialized landscape, marriages function less as a means of wealth transfer and more as mechanisms of debt circulation. Drawing on two decades of ethnographic research and three waves of a quantitative household survey in rural Tamil Nadu, this paper examines how growing dependence on financial capitalism shapes marriage decisions – who marries whom, at what cost, with what consequences. Quantitative analysis identifies broad trends and correlations, while ethnographic insights uncover the complex negotiations and trade-offs between families, linking individual and familial trajectories to the region’s political economy. While dowries have become widespread, their financial impact varies: families of grooms often use them to reduce debt, whereas families of brides see their financial burdens grow. Weddings and dowries reflect and reinforce the devaluation of women, mirroring agricultural decline, land fragmentation, and the precarious yet rising investment in education amid labor force proletarianization. Rather than offsetting inequalities, ceremonial gifts function as a reverse redistribution mechanism, benefiting wealthier, higher-caste families, particularly those with sons or those investing in education. Ultimately, the dowry system subsidizes both an unstable job market and the financial industry.
Combining multivariate and qualitative analyses, this micro-level study suggests an explanation for the persistence of informal savings in rural south India despite publicly run large-scale programmes to promote bank savings. Gold, in particular, but also Rotating Saving and Credit Associations (ROSCAs) and private lending, remain the dominant forms of savings. We argue that cultural norms and social institutions, such as social class and caste, shape the nature of savings, and also the propensity and opportunities to save. Gold serves multiple purposes, financial, economic, socio-cultural and political. Furthermore, we find that the preference of Dalits (the lowest caste) for gold illustrates a relative emancipation, which contrasts with the persistence of caste-related prohibitions preventing them investing in other assets, such as land.
There is growing evidence that microcredit does little to support self-employment. Two main explanations are typically emphasized: from a microeconomic perspective, the poor have been argued to lack the skills, resources and motivation to start their own businesses; from a macroeconomic perspective, local markets are often saturated. This article uses first-hand data from rural South India to explore a third explanation which focuses on the social regulation of markets. Drawing on a household survey, the authors show that self-employment and microcredit are uncorrelated, and that women and lower castes have a significantly lower chance of starting up a business. The businesses they do start tend to be smaller, less profitable and based in very specific sectors. Qualitative insights into the workings of local economies show that caste and gender-based social regulations influence local markets determining who can produce or sell what, to whom, and at what price. The authors observe that real markets are affected by power relations and structured through social institutions rather than being the sum of interactions between free and competitive individuals. These findings show the importance of integrating self-employment programmes into broader policies for transforming the social regulation of markets and for eradicating discrimination against women and lower castes.
In a context marked by many structural changes and high inequalities, longitudinal studies appear to be particularly useful and revealing in analysing the extent of socio-economic dynamics. This paper aims to propose a broad picture of socio-economic dynamics, in particular labour and migration, in rural areas of Tamil Nadu for the last decade using an original first-hand longitudinal survey called NEEMSIS (Networks, Employment, dEbt, Mobilities, and Skills in India Survey). Although NEEMSIS cannot compete with large-scale national surveys, it reveals what they miss by exploring finer socio-economic processes, such as household financial practices, transformation of work, individual’s access and use of social networks and cognition, and social mobility trajectories.
This paper draws on a survey conducted in rural Tamil Nadu in southern India to examine the meanings and implications of recent developments in debt relationships for social relations. While some changes and differentiation practices were observed, we also found persisting social hierarchies based on creditor-debtor relationships. In a context where patron-client mentalities shape redistributive social protection measures, and rules of reciprocity are limited to inter-caste relationships, bonds of hierarchical debt continue to play a key role in terms of protection.
In 2003, the then Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu in southern India, Jayaram Jayalalithaa, gave a speech about the “silent revolution” of the empowerment of Indian women. But 15 years on, regrettably, the promises of that revolution do not seem to have been fulfilled. Thanks to the various programs set up to champion women’s empowerment (involving local NGOs, public programs, and international support), women are now more prominent in certain public spaces and are able to play a genuine advocacy role with regard to the public authorities. Girls education has also significantly improved. But it has not brought about improved employment opportunities. Women are in fact losing out on paid employment (as is the case in India as a whole). They are also heavily indebted (not only from microcredit, but also informal lending and lending from private financial companies). Their indebtedness is disproportionate to their income, and compared to men. Moreover, women almost exclusively put debt toward the social reproduction of families. Reduced opportunities for paid employment and massive debt have hit Dalit women particularly hard. The analyses of this chapter use data collected over more than a decade in a rural area of Tamil Nadu, drawing together ethnography and quantitative data, including panel data (2010–2016). They shed light on the complexity of social change, intertwining forms of domination (here, caste, and gender), and the ambiguous qualities of so-called empowerment programs, whose impacts have been various and unexpected.
The authors present the “Networks, Employment, dEbt, Mobilities, and Skills in India Survey” (NEEMSIS) longitudinal dataset collected through a baseline survey conducted in 2010 and follow-up surveys since 2016 (2016-17 and 2020-21 for the time being) among more than 600 households in rural Tamil Nadu, India. The NEEMSIS survey aims to understand the links between labour, skills, financial practices, social and migration dynamics and social network formation in India. The data set is useful in many ways: (i) the data are able to capture processes that are poorly measured by national surveys in developing countries, (ii) compared to other micro-surveys, NEEMSIS benefits from the coverage of a relatively large population, (iii) the data cover a wide range of information on households and individuals, (iv) the longitudinal nature of NEEMSIS data means that it is possible to observe dynamics and changes over time.
Numbers are both shaped by and constitutive of a certain vision of the world, and household debt is no exception. Financialized capitalism relies on hegemonic numbers that serve the economic and political interests of state government and the financial industry, which see and measure debt as a market ripe for development. In the face of this, it is crucial to build alternative numbers. The political numbers of debt conceive debt as a power relation, and quantify the degrees of financial exploitation that hegemonic numbers are blind to. Ordinary numbers seek to reflect what matters the most to ordinary people. They conceive of debt as a relationship of social interdependence, which can be a source of power, hierarchy and exploitation, but also of mutual aid, reciprocity and dignity. Far from functioning in silos, hegemonic numbers, political numbers and ordinary numbers have shifting boundaries. This article, based on twenty years of research in India conducted by a Franco-Indian team of economists and anthropologists, exposes and contributes to the politics of numbers in the field of debt.
Women, and particularly poor women, have become essential cogs in the wheel of financialized capitalism. Globally, women are responsible for managing household debt, and that debt has exploded over the last decade, reaching an all-time high after the COVID-19 pandemic. Across various categories of loans, including subprime lending, microcredit policies, and consumer loans, as well as rent and utilities, women are overrepresented as clients and managers, and are being enfolded into the system. The Indebted Woman discusses the crucial yet invisible roles poor women play in making and consolidating debt and credit markets. The authors spent over two decades observing a credit market that specifically targets women in the Indian countryside of east-central Tamil Nadu. They found that paying off debts required labor, frequently involved sexual transactions, and shaped women’s bodies and subjectivities. Bringing together ethnography, statistical surveys, and financial diaries, they offer for the first time a comprehensive theory for this sexual division of debt that goes far beyond the Indian case, exposing the ways capitalism transforms womanhood and how this transformation in turn fuels capitalism.
This micro-level study combines multivariate and qualitative analyses to highlight the fragmented nature of debt in southern Indian rural households. It finds that debt is socially regulated in the sense that social interactions shape the cost, use and access to debt. Caste, social class and location affect how individuals borrow varying amounts from distinct money providers, for varied purposes and at differing costs. Debt thus is not purely an economic but first and foremost a social transaction which inscribes debtors and creditors into local systems of hierarchies. Furthermore, we find that debt is an illustration and catalyst of broader socio-economic and political trends, namely a lack of social protection, persistent under-employment and rising consumerism. In terms of policy implications, the study highlights the ambiguities and illusions inherent to ‘financial inclusion' policies aiming to eradicate informal debt.

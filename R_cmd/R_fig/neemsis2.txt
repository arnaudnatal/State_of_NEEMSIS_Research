Anthropology has long shown that kinship, marriage, and systems of production and accumulation are deeply intertwined. In rural Tamil Nadu’s increasingly financialized landscape, marriages function less as a means of wealth transfer and more as mechanisms of debt circulation. Drawing on two decades of ethnographic research and three waves of a quantitative household survey in rural Tamil Nadu, this paper examines how growing dependence on financial capitalism shapes marriage decisions – who marries whom, at what cost, with what consequences. Quantitative analysis identifies broad trends and correlations, while ethnographic insights uncover the complex negotiations and trade-offs between families, linking individual and familial trajectories to the region’s political economy. While dowries have become widespread, their financial impact varies: families of grooms often use them to reduce debt, whereas families of brides see their financial burdens grow. Weddings and dowries reflect and reinforce the devaluation of women, mirroring agricultural decline, land fragmentation, and the precarious yet rising investment in education amid labor force proletarianization. Rather than offsetting inequalities, ceremonial gifts function as a reverse redistribution mechanism, benefiting wealthier, higher-caste families, particularly those with sons or those investing in education. Ultimately, the dowry system subsidizes both an unstable job market and the financial industry.
In a context marked by many structural changes and high inequalities, longitudinal studies appear to be particularly useful and revealing in analysing the extent of socio-economic dynamics. This paper aims to propose a broad picture of socio-economic dynamics, in particular labour and migration, in rural areas of Tamil Nadu for the last decade using an original first-hand longitudinal survey called NEEMSIS (Networks, Employment, dEbt, Mobilities, and Skills in India Survey). Although NEEMSIS cannot compete with large-scale national surveys, it reveals what they miss by exploring finer socio-economic processes, such as household financial practices, transformation of work, individual’s access and use of social networks and cognition, and social mobility trajectories.
The authors present the “Networks, Employment, dEbt, Mobilities, and Skills in India Survey” (NEEMSIS) longitudinal dataset collected through a baseline survey conducted in 2010 and follow-up surveys since 2016 (2016-17 and 2020-21 for the time being) among more than 600 households in rural Tamil Nadu, India. The NEEMSIS survey aims to understand the links between labour, skills, financial practices, social and migration dynamics and social network formation in India. The data set is useful in many ways: (i) the data are able to capture processes that are poorly measured by national surveys in developing countries, (ii) compared to other micro-surveys, NEEMSIS benefits from the coverage of a relatively large population, (iii) the data cover a wide range of information on households and individuals, (iv) the longitudinal nature of NEEMSIS data means that it is possible to observe dynamics and changes over time.
Numbers are both shaped by and constitutive of a certain vision of the world, and household debt is no exception. Financialized capitalism relies on hegemonic numbers that serve the economic and political interests of state government and the financial industry, which see and measure debt as a market ripe for development. In the face of this, it is crucial to build alternative numbers. The political numbers of debt conceive debt as a power relation, and quantify the degrees of financial exploitation that hegemonic numbers are blind to. Ordinary numbers seek to reflect what matters the most to ordinary people. They conceive of debt as a relationship of social interdependence, which can be a source of power, hierarchy and exploitation, but also of mutual aid, reciprocity and dignity. Far from functioning in silos, hegemonic numbers, political numbers and ordinary numbers have shifting boundaries. This article, based on twenty years of research in India conducted by a Franco-Indian team of economists and anthropologists, exposes and contributes to the politics of numbers in the field of debt.
Using original data on 1,635 individuals from rural South India, we analyse the correlation between indebtedness, locus of control and social identity (gender and caste) among borrowers. While locus of control is correlated with debt negotiation, we observe that the relationship is strongest for non-Dalit men (middle and upper castes). This result suggests that a more internal locus of control is an additional asset in negotiation for individuals who already enjoy a favourable social position.
How have rural populations in India mobilised their social networks in times of forced “social distancing”? Focusing on a rural region in Tamil Nadu, mixing Social Network Analysis, descriptive statistics and qualitative interviews conducted before the lockdown, during the lockdown and its aftermath, this paper shows that kinship ties and caste-based relationships are still used as inescapable economic resources, especially when it comes to survive in this unprecedented worldwide economic and social crisis. The region under study has undergone profound changes in recent decades, combining the disappearance of agrarian forms of dependency and the emergence of economic solidarity among the lower castes (measured here in terms of homophily). The crisis is putting these social networks to the test. Subsidised food, the only pro-poor measure of the Indian government, prevented famine, even if it did not prevent severe malnutrition. Although strong ties (kin and caste solidarity) played a key role in helping households to survive, they did not prevent the resurgence of old forms of patronage.
Women, and particularly poor women, have become essential cogs in the wheel of financialized capitalism. Globally, women are responsible for managing household debt, and that debt has exploded over the last decade, reaching an all-time high after the COVID-19 pandemic. Across various categories of loans, including subprime lending, microcredit policies, and consumer loans, as well as rent and utilities, women are overrepresented as clients and managers, and are being enfolded into the system. The Indebted Woman discusses the crucial yet invisible roles poor women play in making and consolidating debt and credit markets. The authors spent over two decades observing a credit market that specifically targets women in the Indian countryside of east-central Tamil Nadu. They found that paying off debts required labor, frequently involved sexual transactions, and shaped women’s bodies and subjectivities. Bringing together ethnography, statistical surveys, and financial diaries, they offer for the first time a comprehensive theory for this sexual division of debt that goes far beyond the Indian case, exposing the ways capitalism transforms womanhood and how this transformation in turn fuels capitalism.
This study is the first attempt to examine the extent to which the Big Five personality traits and cognitive skills (Raven scores, numeracy, and literacy scores) are correlated with debt negotiation and debt management in a Global South country; and how social identity – in particular caste and gender – channels the effect of cognition on debt outcomes. Using a panel dataset built from an original household survey (called NEEMSIS) conducted in 2016–2017 and 2020–2021 in rural Tamil Nadu, India, and employing multivariate correlation probit analysis with lagged variables, we find the following. Firstly, conscientiousness is an advantage in the negotiation and management of debt, particularly for non-Dalit women, suggesting that, in a rural patriarchal context, women leverage personality traits to overcome the constraints of social identity. Secondly, emotional stability is a disadvantage in both debt negotiation and management. Thirdly, the role of cognition and in particular the Raven score is ambiguous.
Taking the case of rural South India, we explore the universality of the Big Five personality traits and their stability over time. We then investigate the effects of two exogenous shocks on trait stability: the demonetisation of November 2016 and the second COVID-19 lockdown. We use an original longitudinal dataset collected in 2016-2017 and 2020-2021. After correcting the data for acquiescence bias and performing factor analysis, we find that three personality traits emerge: emotional stability, plasticity, and conscientiousness. We find no evidence of temporal stability. Results from the covariate-balancing propensity score weighting model shows that the demonetisation impacts plasticity and conscientiousness, with exposed individuals scoring notably higher. The second COVID-19 lockdown exerts a negative impact on emotional stability.

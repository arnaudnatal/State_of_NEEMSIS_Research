# Foreword

<table>
<tr>
<td>

This document provides an overview of the research undertaken using the original <a href="https://neemsis.hypotheses.org"><i>Network, Employment, dEbt, Mobility, and Skills in South India Survey</i></a> (NEEMSIS).

NEEMSIS is a longitudinal data collection tool that aims at understanding the links between labour, skills, financial practices, social and migration dynamics and social networks formation in rural Tamil Nadu, India, through individual and household surveys.
NEEMSIS is based on the baseline survey RUME (<a href="https://odriis.hypotheses.org/rume"><i>RUral Microfinance and Employment</i></a>) conducted in 2010.
NEEMSIS has so far been conducted in 2016–2017 and 2020–2021 among more than 600 households.
A third wave of NEEMSIS is planned for 2025-2026 (which will constitute a panel with four points in time between 2010 and 2025-2026).

These data collections are carried out within the framework of the <a href="https://odriis.hypotheses.org/"><i>Observatory of Rural Dynamics and Inequalities in South India</i></a> (ODRIIS).

# Data access request

Data are freely available on [DataSuds](https://dataverse.ird.fr/dataverse/odriis).

|Data\*    | Before 2025   | Since 2025\*\*|
|----------|---------------|---------------|
|RUME      | 7             | 0             |
|NEEMSIS-1 | 5             | 1             |
|NEEMSIS-2 | 0             | 3             |

\*Household data is the master database. Other shared databases (e.g., loans, occupations, etc.) must always be associated with the household database. That is why only requests for household bases are reported here.

\*\*Since January 2025, access to data requires that: (i) the applicant complete a data use agreement; (ii) the request be validated by the survey manager.

## Projects

- *The curse of having a job. Threats on female employment in a context of rising patriarcal norms*. Using NEEMSIS-2, Di Santolo, Guérin, and Mouchel (corresponding author) want to.
- *Intra-household inequality and recourse to debt*. Using NEEMSIS-3, Di Santolo and Natal (corresponding author) want to study the effects of intra-household inequalities in consumption and income on household/individual debt (recourse, burden).
- *The Ties That Bind: Lender-Borrower Relationships and Indebtedness in Rural South India*. Using NEEMSIS-2, Girollet and Natal (corresponding author) want to study the effects of lender-borrower relationships on loan characteristics (price, repayment difficulties, services associated with loans).
- *The Role of Networks in Labor Market Segmentation*. Using NEEMSIS-2, Mouchel (corresponding author) wants to.
- *The Financial Burden of Education in Rural South India*. Using NEEMSIS-3, Natal (corresponding author) wants to study the financialisation/commodification of education: How much does education cost? How do families finance it? What are the effects on family debt? What are the effects in terms of well-being?
<ins>Collaboration:</ins> Guérin, Nordman
- *Stability Over Time of the Locus of Control*. Using NEEMSIS-2 and NEEMSIS-3, in a short paper, Natal (corresponding author) wants to examine the stability of the locus of control over time. Conduct regressions to examine the explanatory factors of change. Possibly conduct a PSM with the effects of COVID.
<ins>Collaboration:</ins> Nordman
- *Household Indebtedness Landscape: Evolution between 2010 and 2025*. Using RUME to NEEMSIS-3, Natal (corresponding author) wants to conduct a loan-level MCA to look at the transformation of debt practices since 2010. Try to extract household-level variables to do econometrics and look at the determinants of financial vulnerability. \\
<ins>Collaboration:</ins> Guérin, Michiels?
